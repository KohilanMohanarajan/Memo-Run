# Memo Run
A small game that is used to help memorize material from a course of your choosing, or can be used as a Trivia Game!

#How to Install
Installing it is pretty simple, this repository comes with the game in application form in various folders suiting their respective environments, such as Windows(32-bit and 64-bit), and Linux.  Just download, and play the application straight from those folders.  The source code, which can be opened in the Processing IDE, can be found in the root of the Memo folder.

#How to play
First, please ensure that your .txt file is properly formatted.  A txt file has been included with every version of the game to show how to format the questions.  Please do not remove the lines containing "Thing to Remember,Question,Answer", "EASY", "MEDIUM", and "HARD".  Otherwise, place the .txt file in the same folder as the application.  The application currently only recognizes up to the first five .txt files in the respective folder, so do keep that in mind when adding .txt files to the folder.

#Issues
If there are any issues with the game, or if anything crashes, please do contact me ASAP.

#Updates
I will try and update the game as much as possible within my free time, adding new features and functionality.  Here are some things that I've planned to eventually include:
- Music/Audio (STATUS: Incomplete)
- Changing the formatting of the .txt file (STATUS: Incomplete)
- Graphics overhaul (STATUS: Incomplete)
- and More
